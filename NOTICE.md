This repository contains original work by the author and, optionally, code derived from or dependent on external projects.

If this repository vendors (includes) code from the official 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) repository, the following applies:

- The 3DGS code is licensed under the Inria *Non-Commercial Research/Evaluation* license.
- See: https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/blob/main/LICENSE.md
- Any parts of this repository derived from 3DGS remain subject to that license.
- Original additions in this repository are provided under the MIT License (see LICENSE-ADDITIONS).

If this repository does not include 3DGS code (recommended), then this project merely depends on 3DGS. In that case, only the author's original code is present here and it is under MIT, and users should obtain 3DGS separately under its own license.
